### GitHub README File for Building Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex Project

#### Project Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the project completed during the "Building Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex" course offered by DeepLearning.AI. The project involved creating sophisticated AI agents capable of understanding and processing documents using the LlamaIndex framework. Each lesson built progressively on knowledge and skills to design and implement complex AI solutions.

#### Course Modules
- **Lesson 1: Router Engine**
  - Focus on setting up router query engines for efficient document handling.
- **Lesson 2: Tool Calling**
  - Introduction to creating and utilizing function tools for AI operations.
- **Lesson 3: Building an Agent Reasoning Loop**
  - Techniques to enhance AI decision-making through advanced reasoning loops.
- **Lesson 4: Building a Multi-Document Agent**
  - Integrating multiple documents into a single agent to perform comprehensive data analysis.

#### Files in this Repository
- `L1_Router_Engine.py` - Implements the setup of a router query engine.
- `L2_Tool_Calling.py` - Demonstrates how to create and call function tools within an AI agent.
- `L3_Building_an_Agent_Reasoning_Loop.py` - Provides the logic for constructing and running an agent reasoning loop.
- `L4_Building_a_Multi_Document_Agent.py` - Explores the setup of an agent that can handle queries across multiple documents.

#### How to Use
To explore the functionality of these scripts:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install necessary dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run each script to understand the flow of data and agent interactions within the LlamaIndex framework.
